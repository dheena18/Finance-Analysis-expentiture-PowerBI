# Personal Finance Dashboard with PowerBI



## Overview

The Personal Finance Dashboard is a PowerBI project designed to empower users with insightful tools for analyzing spending and income patterns. By providing a comprehensive view of their financial data, users can make informed decisions to optimize their finances and achieve their financial goals. This repository contains the code and resources used to create the dashboard.






## Project Steps

### 1. Data Collection

Gathering data from diverse sources, including bank statements, credit card statements, Khata Book records, Splitwise logs, and even cash transactions, forms the foundational step of the project. This ensures that a holistic representation of spending habits is captured, enabling accurate analysis and informed insights.

### 2. Data Preparation

The collected data undergoes a structured transformation process to create a unified dataset. This step involves mapping various data sources to common attributes like Category, Subcategory, Credit/Debit, Month, and Amount. Standardizing the data facilitates a consistent and clear analysis of spending and income.

### 3. Data Cleaning

In this phase, the Power BI Editor is employed to refine the dataset. Additional columns are introduced to enhance the data's analytical potential, while irrelevant columns are removed to keep the focus on key insights. Data types are meticulously adjusted to ensure accurate calculations and visualizations.

### 4. Ideation

The dashboard's design is driven by a clear ideation process. Insights to uncover patterns such as the correlation between spending and income, identifying high-spending categories, tracking expenses over specific time frames, and understanding trends emerge during this phase. By structuring these ideas in a PowerPoint file, the dashboard's layout and visualizations are aligned with the project's goals.

### 5. Execution

Leveraging the power of Power BI, the ideated concepts are brought to life, creating a dynamic and intuitive dashboard. This execution step empowers users with interactive visualizations that allow them to explore their financial data and derive meaningful conclusions. Through the dashboard, users can make informed decisions that align with their financial objectives.
